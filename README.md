My plan here is to create a wireless stack which uses sound waves to carry information wirelessly.

I also want to turn this into a tutorial for radio systems. Therefore I will do my best to have the stack closely resemble an RF system.

- Sound waves (free to use) will be used instead of radio waves (licensed/restricted) as we can tinker freely
- Each OSI layer will be explained in optimal detail
- Each layer of OSI and each feature will be implemented as distinctly as possible
- Stack will be built in such as fashion, that replacing the physical layer with a radio system will be very easy
- Stack will explain physical layer implementation as if it is a system that uses a wireless radio (RF)
